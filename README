Programming project for FIT CSE 5211 Analysis of Algorithms course.

Contains three different implementations of polynomial multiplication, all
of which are based on the FFT.

   1. Recursive
   2. Iterative
   3. Parallel
   
The recursive and iterative implementations will execute on the CPU, and the parallel
implementation will execute on the GPU, using OpenCL.
